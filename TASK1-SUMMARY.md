# Task 11 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented task 11 "Создание заглушек для других подграфов" (Creating stubs for other subgraphs) with both subtasks completed.

## Completed Subtasks

### 11.1 Users Subgraph Implementation ✅

**Location:** `users-subgraph/`

**Features Implemented:**
- Basic GraphQL schema for user management
- Mock data service with 3 test users
- Federation-ready entity resolvers
- Health check endpoint
- JWKS endpoint stub for JWT validation
- Comprehensive integration tests

**GraphQL Schema:**
```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  phone: String
  createdAt: String!
  updatedAt: String!
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
  users: [User!]!
  findUserById(id: ID!): User  # Federation entity resolver
}
```

**Endpoints:**
- GraphQL: `http://localhost:4002/graphql`
- Health: `http://localhost:4002/health`
- JWKS: `http://localhost:4002/.well-known/jwks.json`

### 11.2 Offers Subgraph Implementation ✅

**Location:** `offers-subgraph/`

**Features Implemented:**
- Basic GraphQL schema for car listings/offers
- Mock data service with 3 test offers
- Federation-ready entity resolvers
- User reference type for cross-subgraph relationships
- Health check endpoint
- Comprehensive integration tests

**GraphQL Schema:**
```graphql
type Offer {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String!
  price: Int!
  currency: String!
  year: Int!
  mileage: Int!
  location: String!
  sellerId: ID!
  createdAt: String!
  updatedAt: String!
  isActive: Boolean!
  seller: User!  # Federation relationship
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  offers: [Offer!]!  # Extends User from Users subgraph
}

type Query {
  offer(id: ID!): Offer
  offers: [Offer!]!
  offersBySeller(sellerId: ID!): [Offer!]!
  findOfferById(id: ID!): Offer  # Federation entity resolver
}
```

**Endpoints:**
- GraphQL: `http://localhost:4004/graphql`
- Health: `http://localhost:4004/health`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- **Language:** Rust
- **GraphQL Library:** async-graphql 7.0
- **Web Framework:** Axum 0.8
- **Federation:** Ready for Apollo Federation integration
- **Testing:** Comprehensive integration tests for all functionality

### Mock Data
- **Users:** 3 mock users with Russian names and phone numbers
- **Offers:** 3 mock car offers (BMW X5, Toyota Camry, Mercedes-Benz C-Class)
- **Relationships:** Proper seller-offer relationships established

### Federation Readiness
Both subgraphs are designed to work with Apollo Federation:
- Entity resolvers implemented (`findUserById`, `findOfferById`)
- Cross-subgraph references properly structured
- User type extended in Offers subgraph to include offers relationship
- Offer type references User type from Users subgraph

### Testing
- **Users Subgraph:** 3 integration tests covering basic queries and federation
- **Offers Subgraph:** 3 integration tests covering offers queries and relationships
- All tests pass successfully

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Requirement 3.1:** Federated types and relationships properly defined
✅ **Requirement 3.2:** Cross-subgraph data composition through reference resolvers

## Next Steps

The subgraph stubs are now ready for:
1. Integration with Apollo Router for federation
2. Database integration (currently using mock data)
3. Authentication and authorization implementation
4. Production deployment configuration

## Usage

### Running the Users Subgraph
```bash
cd users-subgraph
cargo run
```

### Running the Offers Subgraph
```bash
cd offers-subgraph
cargo run
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Users subgraph tests
cd users-subgraph
cargo test

# Offers subgraph tests
cd offers-subgraph
cargo test
```

Both subgraphs are fully functional GraphQL services that can be integrated into the federated architecture as designed in the specification.
